- 👋 Hi, I’m Massimo.
- 🌱💻 I’m interested in sustainability and programming. I believe technology can make the significant contribution needed to overpass the societal crisis.
- 📚 I’m currently enrolled in the Master of Science in Sustainable Management and Technology (SMT) program, offered by E4S on behalf of its three partner institutions (IMD Business School, EPFL, and UNIL). It aims to equip the entrepreneurs and intrapreneurs of the future with the knowledge and skills to contribute to the transition toward a more resilient, environmentally responsible, and inclusive economy while harnessing the power of technology.
- 🌍 I’m looking to collaborate on impactful projects. My background in economics, my knowledge of sustainability issues, and my passion for programming want to be proven through societal and environmental challenges.
